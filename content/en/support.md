xHain is mainly financed by membership fees, but one-off donations are always welcome and help us to further develop our space.

## Become a member

We get asked a lot how our membership works. Actually, xHain is different from most other spaces, since we are an _open_ space and you _don't have to_ become a member to hang out and have fun with us. But of course, we welcome any donations and memberships that will help support us.

Most members typically donate 13.37€ or more per month. You will be assigned a random tree name, which we kindly ask you to use as description/reference in your bank transfer to our xHain bank account. You will receive the payment details by email after signing up.

You can either use the form below (data will be send to us via formspree.com) - or just send us an email.

## Donations

If you would like to support us, you're welcome to donate a small or bigger amount to the following bank account:

Accountholder: xHain hack+makespace gemeinnützige UG (haftungsbeschränkt)<br>

## Renting the Place

You can rent xHain for a small conference or an event. Huge birthday parties may not be advisable, but if you’re planning a workshop, if you’re looking for an unconventional place for your meetings, if you want to screen your movie or if you’re looking for a creative environment where you can write your fan fiction, just contact us and we’ll work out the details.
