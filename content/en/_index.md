Are you unsure if xHain is the right place for you? No matter if you're a hacker, maker or simply curious: it doesn't matter how much experience you have or how much you can contribute, it only matters whether you are interested in topics such as coding, electronics & soldering, woodworking, lasercutting, CNC milling, 3D printing, textiles & sewing, etc. 

**Our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/xRoots" target="_blank">xRoots</a> mentors are here for *you*: They will hang out and chat with you on monday nights, answer any questions you may have, will help you get started at xHain and give you a tour of the place. If you have any special needs, look for people wearing the xRoots logo/badge on monday nights or have an <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">online chat</a> with us.**

Concerns about "not belonging", not being a hacker or maker (yet) or having special needs should not prevent you from feeling comfortable with us. Even if you are introverted or shy, most of the members are friendly folk you can easily talk to at any time. If you are looking for a personal contact, simply contact an <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/xRoots" target="_blank">xRoots</a> mentor in our chat.
