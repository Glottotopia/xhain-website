**Welcome to xHain: Hack- & Makespace in the heart of Friedrichshain, tinkering room for people interested in technology + space for net politics.**

## xHain locked down from Nov, 28th 2021 

Hey,

so the official rules require a strict 2G+ protocol. Unfortunately we don't see us being able to control this reliably... It's been hard enough to keep the 2G rules checked.
We believe - unfortunately - it's time to lockdown the xHain effective immediately. No open Monday, meetups or events.

And then we'll have look a week before Christmas, if we think we'll be able to open under city rules ((2G+ or what is then required) for the rC3.
We're really sorry that we have to take this drastics step - again. ☹

We really hope that we'll be able to have a rC3 with an audience and workshops - we think we can organise and control a stricter hygiene regime for those four days, but for now we don't see another solution.

Hope to see you all soon!
Your xHain-team
