To have a local place for exchanges, mutual learning and fun: that’s the vision for xHain.<br>
**During the day:** a place where projects and school groups can learn.<br>
**At night:** a place where hackers and makers can meet.<br>
**At other times:** a conference room or a temporary desk for Friedrichshainers with no office to go to.

## Who It’s For
We want to create a place where makers, people who are interested in tech, and (society) hackers feel comfortable.
You’re welcome no matter who you are or what you do – whether you have a job or not, whether you’re a trainee or a student, a single parent or a senior citizen.

xHain is a non-smoking place. People who want to smoke can do so outside.
If you’re an asshole, e.g. sexist, racist, or homophobic, please don’t bother coming.

We take inclusivity very seriously and hence have put together an awareness team as well as our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/xRoots" target="_blank">xroots mentors</a> as personal contacts for you.

## Accessibility
People with handicaps and disabilities are welcome! We don't have an accessibly designed bathroom yet, but a mobile ramp and our workshops workbench is wheelchair accessible. We are constantly trying to improve in order to become a barrier-free space.

You can find more info about our physical space and a floor map <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/rooms-and-equipment" target="_blank">here</a>.

# First Steps
The first thing you should do before entering xHain or our <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">rocket chat</a> is to read and respect our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/de/xHain/spacerules" target="_blank">space rules</a>. Before spending time alone in our space, you probably already have received a personal introduction and tour. If this has not already been done, please ask any member for a guided tour on a Monday evening.

## important links and accounts
- If you haven't done so yet, it is advisable to create an account for our <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">Rocket Chat</a>. This is not mandatory, but it is our main means of communication at xHain between members and also non-members. We also have a mailing list for members only, but we use it sparsely and only for important announcements or dates. Everything else is communicated in the chat.
- <a href="https://chaos.social/@xhain_hackspace" target="_blank">Fediverse</a>  or <a href="https://twitter.com/xHain_hackspace" target="_blank">Twitter</a>: public announcements about workshops or other events. 
- calendar on our webseite: regular events and meetups.
- <a href="https://gitlab.com/xHain-hackspace" target="_blank">gitlab</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/xHain-hackspace" target="_blank">github</a>: source code of xHain projects.
- <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de" target="_blank">Wiki</a>: project documentations and more info.
- We also have a <a href="https://files.x-hain.de" target="_blank">nextcloud</a> installation. To get an account please contact @reimerei in our Rocket chat.
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCndtqJj4CxWpn2PDdBE6q8g" target="_blank">youtube</a>: our videos of course :)

We would like to keep the #general chatroom of our Rocket Chat (chat.x-hain.de) clean and tidy. Topic specific requests therefore belong in the corresponding chatrooms. Please create separate "channels" or "discussions" for chitchat and small talk. You can find an overview of the most important channels in our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/spacerules#rocket-chat" target="_blank">space rules</a>.

## member box, materials, storage at xHain
If you require storage space, you can get a personal box, our so called member box, to store your personal projects and stuff at xHain. Please take anything home with you that doesn't fit into this box. We are not a storage location and do not want to have any large craft or tinkering projects laying around. The same goes for workpieces and materials like wood or acrylic plates etc., do not store them at xHain! We have a general rule that any material you find at xHain may be used by anyone (please donate a small amount into our donation box). Name tags are not valid and will be ignored. However, this is not the case for tools and machinery!

## use of machinery and devices
Please also read the sections on "machinery" and "safety" in our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/spacerules" target="_blank">space rules</a>. For some devices or machines it is mandatory to first receive instructions and permissions from authorized members. Our wiki documentations are only a reminder and do NOT replace personal instruction. If the rules of use are violated, permissions can be revoked.

You can find an overview of our equipment on the <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/rooms-and-equipment" target="_blank">rooms and equipment</a> page.

## key authorisation
We have an electronically controlled front door called <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/de/Infrastructure/xDoor" target="_blank">xDoor</a>. New members can apply for a key after 3 months of paid membership (after the 3 months have passed). Be aware that there is no right to be granted key access to xHain. A small group of active longtime members, our so called "Schlüsselkinder" group (latch-key kids), will decide if you will receive a key.

Currently: During times of covid19 we are a little reluctant to grant key authorizations. We do want to have some activity at our space, but we need to ensure our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/hygiene-konzept" target="_blank">hygiene concept</a> is being followed.
