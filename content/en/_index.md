### All creatures welcome

No matter if you're a hacker, maker or simply curious, you are welcome at the xHain. It doesn't matter how much experience you have or if you are a student or retired or anything in between. It only matters whether you are interested in topics such as coding, electronics & soldering, woodworking, lasercutting, CNC milling, 3D printing, textiles & sewing, etc.

People with handicaps and disabilities are welcome! We don't have an accessibly designed bathroom yet, but a mobile ramp and our workshops workbench is wheelchair accessible. We are constantly trying to improve in order to become a barrier-free space.
