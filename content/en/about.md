A local place for exchanges, mutual learning and having fun together.<br>
**During the day:** a place where projects and school groups can learn.<br>
**At night:** a place where hackers and makers can meet.<br>
**At other times:** a conference room or a temporary desk for Friedrichshainers with no office to go to.

## Who It’s For

We want to create a place where makers, people who are interested in tech, and (society) hackers feel comfortable.
You’re welcome no matter who you are or what you do – whether you have a job or not, whether you’re a trainee or a student, a single parent or a senior citizen.

xHain is a non-smoking place. People who want to smoke can do so outside.
If you’re an asshole, e.g. sexist, racist, or homophobic, please don’t bother coming.

We take inclusivity very seriously and hence have put together an awareness team as well as our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/xRoots" target="_blank">xroots mentors</a> as personal contacts for you.

## Accessibility

People with handicaps and disabilities are welcome! We don't have an accessibly designed bathroom yet, but a mobile ramp and our workshops workbench is wheelchair accessible. We are constantly trying to improve in order to become a barrier-free space.

You can find more info about our physical space and a floor map <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/rooms-and-equipment" target="_blank">here</a>.

## Awareness Team

If you have suggestions for inclusivity improvements, personal or confidential concerns, needs, worries or problems in the context of xHain, please contact one of the following people in our <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">rocket chat</a>. All information will be kept strictly confidential.

## xRoots mentors

You're new to xHain and would like to check it out?

Concerns about “not belonging”, not being a hacker or maker (yet) or having special needs should not prevent you from feeling comfortable with us. Even if you are introverted or shy, most of the members are friendly folk you can easily talk to at any time. If you prefer a personal contact, simply contact an <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/xRoots" target="_blank">xroots mentor</a> in our chat or look out for people wearing the xRoots logo/badge on monday nights.

# getting started as a new member

The first thing you should be aware of before entering xHain or our <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">rocket chat</a> is our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/de/xHain/spacerules" target="_blank">space rules</a>. Before spending time alone in our space, you probably already have received a personal introduction and tour. If this has not already been done, please ask any member for a guided tour on a Monday evening.

## your support as a member
This is how you can help out:
- Be friendly and welcoming to everyone :)
- Keep our space clean and tidy. Please empty rubbish bins in the back yard and tidy up workspace areas. Please also keep the kitchen sink clean. 
- Drinks are financed and organized by members for members: please help keep the fridge stacked with bottles and return empty bottles to our storage area.  

## important links and accounts

If you haven't done so yet, it is advisable to create an account for our <a href="https://chat.x-hain.de" target="_blank">Rocket Chat</a>. This is not mandatory, but it is our main means of communication at xHain between members and also non-members. We also have a mailing list for members only, but we use it sparsely and only for important announcements or dates. Everything else is communicated in the chat.

We would like to keep the #general chatroom of our Rocket Chat (chat.x-hain.de) clean and tidy. Topic specific requests therefore belong in the corresponding chatrooms. Please create separate "channels" or "discussions" for chitchat and small talk. You can find an overview of the most important channels in our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/spacerules#rocket-chat" target="_blank">space rules</a>.

## member box, materials, storage at xHain

If you require storage space, you can get a personal box, our so called member box, to store your personal projects and stuff at xHain. Please take anything home with you that doesn't fit into this box. We are not a storage location and do not want to have any large craft or tinkering projects cluttering the place. The same goes for workpieces and materials like wood or acrylic plates etc.: you can store larger things for up to 4 weeks in a large box (put a name tag and date on it!). We will regularly get rid of untagged or outdated things.

## use of machinery and devices

We have colour coded our different work areas and marked the machines and tools with stickers and paint. Some tools require safety training and may only be used after a personal introduction from an authorized instructor. You can find an overview of our equipment and more details on the <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/rooms-and-equipment" target="_blank">rooms and equipment</a> page in our Wiki. 

## key authorisation

We have an electronically controlled front door called <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/de/Infrastructure/xDoor" target="_blank">xDoor</a>. New members can apply for a key after 3 months of paid membership (after the 3 months have passed). Be aware that there is no right to be granted key access to xHain. A small group of active longtime members, our so called "Schlüsselkinder" group (latch-key kids), will decide if you will receive a key.

Currently: During times of covid19 we are a little reluctant to grant key authorizations. We do want to have some activity at our space, but we need to ensure our <a href="https://wiki.x-hain.de/en/xHain/hygiene-konzept" target="_blank">hygiene concept</a> is being followed.
